practice question

# Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s,
# find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s.
# If there isn't one, return 0 instead.


# p minSubLength([2,3,1,2,4,3], 7) == 2
# p minSubLength([1, 10, 5, 2, 7], 9) == 1
# p minSubLength([1, 11, 100, 1, 0, 200, 3, 2, 1, 250], 280) == 4
# p minSubLength([1, 2, 4], 8) == 0
