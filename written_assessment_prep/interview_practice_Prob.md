```ruby
# Given an array of numbers, for each number find out how many numbers
# in the array are smaller than it. When counting numbers, only count
# unique values. That is, if a given number occurs multiple times in
# the array, it should only be counted once.

# Examples:

p smaller_numbers_than_current([8,1,2,2,3]) == [3, 0, 1, 1, 2]
p smaller_numbers_than_current([1,4,6,8,13,2,4,5,4])
                            == [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 2]
p smaller_numbers_than_current([7,7,7,7]) == [0,0,0,0]
p smaller_numbers_than_current([6,5,4,8]) == [2, 1, 0, 3]
p smaller_numbers_than_current([1]) == [0]

# The tests above should print "true".




# Write a method that takes one argument: an array of integers.
# The method should return the minimum sum of 5 consecutive
# numbers in the array. If the array contains fewer than 5
# elements, the method should return nil.

# Examples:

p minimum_sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) == nil
p minimum_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 15
p minimum_sum([55, 2, 6, 5, 1, 2, 9, 3, 5, 100]) == 16
p minimum_sum([-1, -5, -3, 0, -1, 2, -4]) == -10

# The tests above should print "true".



# Write a method named to_weird_case that accepts a string, and
# returns the same sequence of characters with every 2nd character
# in every third word converted to uppercase. Other characters
# should remain the same.

# Examples:

p to_weird_case('Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing') ==
                'Lorem Ipsum iS simply dummy tExT of the pRiNtInG'
p to_weird_case(
  'It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted') ==
  'It is a long established fAcT that a rEaDeR will be dIsTrAcTeD'
p to_weird_case('aaA bB c') == 'aaA bB c'
p to_weird_case(
  'Miss Mary Poppins word is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious') ==
  'Miss Mary POpPiNs word is sUpErCaLiFrAgIlIsTiCeXpIaLiDoCiOuS'

# The tests above should print "true".


# Write a method that takes an array of integers and returns the
# two numbers that are closest together in value.

# Examples:

p closest_numbers([5, 25, 15, 11, 20]) == [15, 11]
p closest_numbers([19, 25, 32, 4, 27, 16]) == [25, 27]
p closest_numbers([12, 7, 17]) == [12, 7]

# The tests above should print "true".



# Write a method that takes a string as an argument and returns
# the character that occurs least often in the given string.
# If there are multiple characters with the equal lowest number
# of occurrences, then return the one that appears first in the
# string. When counting characters, consider the uppercase and
# lowercase version to be the same.

# Examples:

p least_common_char("Hello World") #== "h"
p least_common_char("Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers") #== "t"
p least_common_char("Mississippi") #== "m"
p least_common_char("Happy birthday!") #== ' '
p least_common_char("aaaaaAAAA") #== 'a'

# The tests above should print "true".
